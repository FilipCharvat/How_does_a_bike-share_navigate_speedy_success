## Project Overview: Cyclistic Bike-Share Program Analysis

### Company Background
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago, launched in 2016. The company operates a fleet of 5,824 geo-tracked bicycles and manages a network of 692 docking stations throughout the city. Users can unlock and return bikes at any time. Cyclistic offers three pricing options: single ride, full-day pass, and annual membership. Users who purchase single or day passes are classified as casual riders, while those with annual subscriptions are referred to as Cyclistic members.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
Cyclistic’s offerings include traditional bicycles, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes making the service accessible to a wide range of users, including people with disabilities. While the majority of users ride for leisure, approximately 30% use the service to commute to work daily.</p>

### Marketing Strategy Context
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
The company’s existing marketing strategy has focused on raising awareness and appealing to the general public through email, social media, and other channels. The marketing team is led by Lily Moreno, the Director of Marketing, who is responsible for campaign development and strategic initiatives.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
According to Cyclistic’s financial analysts, annual members are more profitable than casual riders, despite the broader appeal and flexibility of short-term pricing. Moreno believes that increasing the number of annual members is critical to long-term growth and sustainability. She sees an opportunity to convert casual riders into annual members and has set this as a strategic goal.</p>

### Business Objective
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
The primary business task is to analyze how annual members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic bicycles and to develop a targeted marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to become annual members. This requires an understanding of usage patterns, motivations for membership, and how digital media influences user behavior.

### Organizational Roles and Decision-Making

- Director of Marketing (Lily Moreno): Oversees marketing efforts and defines strategic goals.
