<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
The graph shows a clear distinction between user types, as the majority of members use the service mostly on weekdays, suggesting they are commuting to work. For casual users, there is an increase in usage on weekends, which suggests leisure activity. However, there is also a proportion of casual users on weekdays, which could include tourists or unconverted potential members.</p>

The service is used predominantly by male users. When the proportions of member vs. casual users for each gender are calculated, casual users make up 9.7% of the male population and 18% of the female population. This suggests that, although the majority of users are male, there is a higher proportion of unconverted casual users among females.</p>

The graph shows the distribution of trip start times by user type. Member users, previously identified as commuting, show peak usage in the morning and evening, reinforcing the commuting pattern. Casual users predominantly use the service in the afternoon, supporting the idea of leisure-oriented usage.</p>
